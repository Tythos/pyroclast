# pyroclast
Basic Python-based data server for exposing flat table and object hierarchy files via REST-ful queries

You know what's awesome? Setting up a REST-ful server you can start with a single command, out-of-the-box.

You know what's even cooler? Adding file resources to that server just by dragging and dropping said files into a folder.
