At build time, the contents of the pyroclast packages (with the exception of
this folder, of course) are moved into this folder (i.e., this folder will
contain a 'pyroclast/' directory). After updating the setup() parameters in
setup.py, the 'build.bat' script can be run to automatically compile a source
distribution, register it (if not already registered), and push it to PyPI.
